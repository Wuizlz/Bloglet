Title: BlogIt: A Work-in-Progress Full-Stack Blog Management Application

Description:
I’m thrilled to share my ongoing project, BlogIt, a full-stack blog management application designed to provide users with an engaging platform to create, interact with, and explore blog posts. While the project is still a work in progress, it showcases core functionality such as dynamic interactions, secure authentication, and scalable database design.

Key Features (So Far):
	•	Blog Creation: Users can create blogs with titles, rich text content, and optional image uploads.
	•	Dynamic Like System: Users can like blog posts dynamically with real-time updates.
	•	User Authentication: Secure login, registration, and session management using email/password and Google OAuth.
	•	Responsive Design: The application features a responsive user interface, ensuring compatibility across devices.
	•	Real-Time Feedback: Like counts and user interactions update dynamically without page reloads using AJAX.

Tools & Technologies Used:
	•	Frontend:
	•	HTML5, CSS3 (including responsive design)
	•	JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, AJAX)
	•	EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)
	•	Backend:
	•	Node.js with Express.js
	•	Passport.js for authentication (Local Strategy and Google OAuth)
	•	Multer for file uploads (image support)
	•	Database:
	•	PostgreSQL for relational data storage
	•	pg library for database queries
	•	Additional Tools:
	•	Nodemailer for email verification
	•	bcrypt for password hashing
	•	Morgan for logging
	•	Development Environment:
	•	Currently running on a local development environment.

Current Challenges:
	•	Enhancing the like and comment functionality for improved user experience.
	•	Designing a scalable database schema that handles blogs, likes, and comments efficiently.
	•	Refining the UI to improve accessibility and usability across devices.

What I’ve Learned So Far:
Working on BlogIt has been an incredible journey in understanding full-stack development, particularly in managing server-client interactions, designing databases, and creating a seamless user experience. I’ve also gained hands-on experience integrating third-party libraries like Passport.js and Nodemailer.

Next Steps:
As I continue developing BlogIt, my upcoming goals include:
	•	Implementing a comment system with threading and real-time updates.
	•	Adding blog categories and search functionality.
	•	Deploying the application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku or AWS) to make it accessible to users.
